# Anony
A website with anonymous publishing and anonymous comments.
The idea behind this is simple as to give people freedom to express and other's to respond with anonymity.


# Contributing

It is an open source community. Anyone can contribute here. To be an official collaborator drop an email.You can always fork the reporitories in this orgranization to resolve issues or make new contribution and submit pull request to merge it.

We considered starting the projects using simple HTML5 webpages and a light usage of bootstrap framework. Do consult us before you start contributing for appropriate assignments of tasks and better understanding of the architecture.

You can also contribute feeding data into any of the ongoing projects here. You can go to the project website and start uploading data or you can upload raw files on the repositories. We insist on opening an issue (or disucssing in a appropriate existing issue) before you upload any raw file. If possible, developer contributors may be able to make a UI for it to upload and parse the data easily.

Any idea or suggestions will be appreciated.
